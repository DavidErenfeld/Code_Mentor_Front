# Code Mentor Platform - Client Side

## Project Description

This client-side application of a code mentoring platform allows users to collaboratively work on code segments in real time. It offers a dynamic and interactive learning and teaching environment with support for different roles such as mentor and student.

## Key Features

- **Real-time collaborative editing:** Users can see and make changes to the code simultaneously.
- **Roles between mentor and student:** The mentor can only view changes while students can edit.
- **Mentor role transition:** When a mentor leaves, the next student in line becomes the mentor.
- **Success display:** When a student solves a problem correctly, a large smiley emoji is displayed on the screen for a few seconds.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A framework for building reactive user interfaces.
- **Socket.io-client:** Manages real-time communication between the client and the server.
- **Ace Editor:** An embedded code editor for browser-based development.
- **CSS:** Used for styling and customizing the user interface.
